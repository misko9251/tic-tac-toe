# tic-tac-toe oop
Tic-Tac-Toe!

I built this game originally using procedural programming.
I wanted to challenge myself so I went back and used OOP to refactor my code.

I learned a lot going back to this project and had a lot of fun. I enjoyed breaking
this down and using abstraction/getters to make sure the player cannot be changed mid-game. 
Encapsulation made the code much more visually appealing to me. In the future I plan
to add logic to recognize a draw and prompt the user that we have reached the end of the 
game, and give them the option to play again.
